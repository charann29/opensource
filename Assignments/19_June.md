# KNN Classifier Mini Project

## Objective
The goal of this mini-project is to update the Streamlit app found in the [capstone project repository](https://github.com/charann29/cmr_opensource/tree/main/capstone_project) to include functionality for running a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier from the frontend. Additionally, we will raise a Pull Request (PR) from a new branch named `knn-project`.

## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository ( if this is the first time )

### 2. Create a New Branch

### 3. Install Necessary Packages ( use pip install -r requirements.txt )

### 4. Update the Streamlit App ( only the code related KNN should be there )

### 5. Test the Application ( streamlit run app.py )

### 6. Commit and Push Changes

### 7. Create a Pull Request
