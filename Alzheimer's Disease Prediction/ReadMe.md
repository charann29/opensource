## Project Overview
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for managing the disease and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data and other relevant features to detect Alzheimer's Disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes medical imaging data and other features relevant to Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.
