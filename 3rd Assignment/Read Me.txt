KNN Model with Streamlit
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Streamlit for interactive web-based visualization. The application allows users to select from various datasets, configure parameters for KNN (such as number of neighbors and weights), and evaluate the model's performance for classification tasks.

Features
Dataset Selection: Choose from a variety of built-in datasets (e.g., Iris, Breast Cancer) or upload custom datasets.
Algorithm Type: Select between Classifier mode for classification tasks.
Parameter Configuration: Adjust KNN parameters like number of neighbors and weights via user-friendly widgets.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the KNN model on the selected dataset and evaluate its performance with accuracy metrics.
