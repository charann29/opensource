# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST Dataset)
# Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture is designed to learn and recognize patterns in handwritten images, achieving high accuracy in digit recognition tasks.
